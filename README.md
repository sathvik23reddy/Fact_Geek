# Fact_Geek - A one-stop solution to discover absolute truths

-> Fact Geek is an Android app built using Kotlin, taking into consideration of the "Android Architecture Components".
-> The main intent is to provide the user with facts on a simple swipe action.
-> The app uses OkHttp to make an API Call to fetch the fact and presents it to the user on a animated gradient background.
-> The Animated Gradient Background is inspired by the Instagram's login page and is soothing to the eye with a choice of dark-themed colors.
-> The user can Swipe left(implemented as OnSwipeTouchListener) for a new fact and Swipe right to save their fact(Room Database).
-> The saved fact can then be viewed in the saved menu which uses a RecyclerView to present the facts.
-> Each fact can further be shared(Android ShareSheet), copied to clipboard or deleted.
-> Additionally the user is presented with the Instructions on the first startup of the app
